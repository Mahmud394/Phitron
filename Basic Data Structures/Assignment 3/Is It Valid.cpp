available to delete, it will not delete itself.
1 can delete its previous available character  along with itself. If there is no  
available to delete, it will not delete itself.

Note: You need to solve it using STL Stack or Queue only.

Input Format

First line will contain , the number of test cases.
Next  lines will contain the string .

Output Format

Output YES if the string is valid, otherwise NO.
